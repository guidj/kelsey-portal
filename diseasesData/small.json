Signs of a possible broken bone include deformed joints and inability to move the wrist, hand, or a finger. There can also be cartilage injuries in the wrist. Other common injuries include sprain, strain, tendinitis, and bursitis.Arthritis:Arthritis is another common cause of wrist pain, swelling, and stiffness. There are many types of arthritis:Osteoarthritis occurs with age and overuse.Rheumatoid arthritis generally affects both wrists.Psoriatic arthritis accompanies psoriasis.Infectious arthritis is a medical emergency. Signs of an infection include redness and warmth of the wrist, fever above 100\u00b0F (37.7\u00b0C), and recent illness. Other CausesGout: This occurs when your body produces too much uric acid, a waste product. The uric acid forms crystals in the joints, rather than being excreted in the urine.Pseudogout: This occurs when calcium deposits in the joints, causing pain, redness, and swelling.

You can do this by:Wearing loose-fitting clothes and not wearing panty hoseWearing cotton underwear (instead of synthetic fabrics) or underwear that has a cotton lining in the crotch. Cotton increases air flow and decreases moisture buildup.Not wearing underwear at night when you sleepGirls and women should also:Know how to properly clean their genital area while bathing or showering.Wipe properly after using the toilet -- always from front to back.Wash thoroughly before and after using the bathroom.Always practice safe sex, and use condoms to avoid catching or spreading infections.", "Causes": "INFECTIONSYeast infections are one of the most common causes of vulvovaginitis in women. Yeast infections are most often due to the fungus Candida albicans.Candida and the many other germs that normally live in the vagina keep each other in balance. However, sometimes the number of Candida increases, leading to a yeast infection.Yeast infections typically cause genital itching, a thick white vaginal discharge, and other symptoms. The vagina normally contains both healthy bacteria and unhealthy bacteria. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs when more unhealthy bacteria than healthy bacteria grow. BV may cause a thin, grey vaginal discharge and a fishy odor.A less common type of vaginitis is spread by sexual contact. It is called trichomonias. Symptoms in women include genital itching, vaginal odor, and a heavy vaginal discharge that may be yellow-grey or green in color.OTHER CAUSESChemicals can cause itchy rashes in the genital area.Spermicides and vaginal sponges, which are over-the-counter birth control methodsFeminine sprays and perfumesBubble baths and soaps Low estrogen levels in women after menopause can cause vaginal dryness and thinning of the skin of the vagina and vulva. These factors may lead to or worsen genital itching and burning.Other causes include:Tight-fitting or nonabsorbent clothing, which leads to heat rashesSkin conditionsObjects such as a lost tampon can also cause irritation, itching, and strong smelling discharge.Sometimes the exact cause cannot be found. This is called nonspecific vulvovaginitis. It occurs in all age groups, but is most common in young girls before puberty, especially girls with poor genital hygiene.It causes a foul-smelling, brownish-green discharge and irritation of the labia and vaginal opening. This condition is often linked with excess growth of bacteria that are typically found in the stool. These bacteria are sometimes spread from the rectum to the vaginal area by wiping from back to front after using the bathroom.Irritated tissue is more likely to become infected than healthy tissue. Many germs that cause infection thrive in a warm, damp, and dark environment, which can also lead to a longer recovery.Sexual abuse should be considered in young girls with unusual infections and repeated episodes of unexplained vulvovaginitis.

{"Information": "PRIMARY CAREA primary care provider (PCP) is a person you may see first for checkups and health problems. If you have a health care plan, find out what type of practitioner can serve as your PCP.The term \"generalist\" often refers to medical doctors (MDs) and doctors of osteopathic medicine (DOs) who specialize in internal medicine, family practice, or pediatrics.OB/GYNs are doctors who specialize in obstetrics and gynecology, including women's health care, wellness, and prenatal care. Many women use an OB/GYN as their primary care provider.Nurse practitioners (NPs) are nurses with graduate training. They can serve as a primary care provider in family medicine (FNP), pediatrics (PNP), adult care (ANP), or geriatrics (GNP). Others are trained to address women's health care (common concerns and routine screenings) and family planning. NPs can prescribe medications.A physician assistant (PA) can provide a wide range of services in collaboration with a Doctor of Medicine (MD) or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). NURSING CARERegistered nurses (RNs) have graduated from a nursing program, have passed a state board examination, and are licensed by the state.Licensed practical nurses (LPNs) are state-licensed caregivers who have been trained to care for the sick.Advanced practice nurses have education and experience beyond the basic training and licensing required of all RNs. Advanced practice nurses include nurse practitioners (NPs) and the following: Clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) have training in a field such as cardiac, psychiatric, or community health.Certified nurse midwives (CNMs) have training in women's health care needs, including prenatal care, labor and delivery, and the care of a woman who has given birth.Certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) have training in the field of anesthesia. Anesthesia is the process of putting a patient into a painless sleep, and keeping the patient's body working so surgeries or special tests can be done. DRUG THERAPYLicensed pharmacists have graduate training from a college of pharmacy.Your pharmacist prepares and processes drug prescriptions that were written by your primary or specialty care provider. Pharmacists provide information to patients about medications. They also consult with health care providers about dosages, interactions, and side effects of medicines.Your pharmacist may also follow your progress to check that you are using your medicine safely and effectively.Pharmacists also can evaluate your health and prescribe medications.SPECIALTY CAREYour primary care provider may refer you to professionals in various specialties when necessary, such as:Allergy and asthmaAnesthesiology -- general anesthesia or spinal block for surgeries and some forms of pain controlCardiology -- heart disordersDermatology -- skin disordersEndocrinology -- hormonal and metabolic disorders, including diabetesGastroenterology -- digestive system disordersGeneral surgery -- common surgeries involving any part of the bodyHematology -- blood disordersImmunology -- disorders of the immune systemInfectious disease -- infections affecting the tissues of any part of the bodyNephrology -- kidney disordersNeurology -- nervous system disordersObstetrics/gynecology -- pregnancy and women's reproductive disordersOncology -- cancer treatmentOphthalmology -- eye disorders and surgeryOrthopedics -- bone and connective tissue disordersOtorhinolaryngology -- ear, nose, and throat (ENT) disordersPhysical therapy and rehabilitative medicine -- for disorders such as low back injury, spinal cord injuries, and strokePsychiatry -- emotional or mental disordersPulmonary (lung) -- respiratory tract disordersRadiology -- x-rays and related procedures (such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI)Rheumatology -- pain and other symptoms related to joints and other parts of the musculoskeletal systemUrology -- disorders of the male reproductive system and urinary tract and the female urinary tract ", "Title": "Types of health care providers", "URL": "https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001933.htm", "Alternative Names": "Physicians; Nurses; Health care providers; Doctors; Pharmacists", "Related MedlinePlus Health Topics": "Health Occupations ", "Images": " Types of health care providers ", "Update Date ": "Updated by: Linda J.

Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier Saunders; 2015:chap 39.", "Treatment": "Because type 1 diabetes can start quickly and the symptoms can be severe, people who have just been diagnosed may need to stay in the hospital.If you have just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you may need to have a checkup each week until you have good control over your blood sugar. Your doctor will review the results of your home blood sugar monitoring and urine testing. Your doctor will also look at your diary of meals, snacks, and insulin injections. It may take a few weeks to match the insulin doses to your meal and activity schedules.As your diabetes becomes more stable, you will have fewer follow-up visits. Visiting your doctor is very important so you can monitor any long-term problems from diabetes.Your doctor will likely ask you to meet with a dietitian, clinical pharmacist, and diabetes nurse educator. These providers will also help you manage your diabetes.But, you are the most important person in managing your diabetes. You should know the basic steps of diabetes management, including:How to recognize and treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)How to recognize and treat high blood sugar (hyperglycemia)How to plan meals, including carbohydrate (carb) countingHow to give insulinHow to check blood glucose and urine ketonesHow to adjust insulin and food when you exerciseHow to handle sick daysWhere to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them INSULINInsulin lowers blood sugar by allowing it to leave the bloodstream and enter cells. Everyone with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day.Most commonly, insulin is injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or insulin pump. Another form of insulin is the inhaled type. Insulin cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.Insulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last. Your doctor will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it. Some types of insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. Other types of insulin should never be mixed.Your doctor or diabetes educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. At first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or another adult. By age 14, most children can give themselves their own injections.Inhaled insulin comes as a powder that is breathed in (inhaled). It is rapid acting and used just before each meal. Your doctor can tell you if this type of insulin is right for you.People with diabetes need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin they are taking:When they exerciseWhen they are sickWhen they will be eating more or less food and caloriesWhen they are traveling HEALTHY EATING AND EXERCISEBy testing your blood sugar level, you can learn which foods and activities raise or lower your blood sugar level the most. This helps you adjust your insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or too low.The American Diabetes Association and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics have information for planning healthy, balanced meals. It also helps to talk to a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor.Regular exercise helps control the amount of sugar in the blood. It also helps burn extra calories and fat to reach and maintain a healthy weight.Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. People with type 1 diabetes must take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.MANAGING YOUR BLOOD SUGARChecking your blood sugar level yourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.To check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet to get a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.Keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your health care team. These numbers will help if you have problems managing your diabetes. You and your doctor should set a target goal for your blood sugar level at different times during the day. You should also plan what to do when your blood sugar is too low or high.Talk to your doctor about your target for the A1C test. This lab test shows your average blood sugar level over the past 3 months. It shows how well you are controlling your diabetes. For most persons with type 1 diabetes, the A1C target should be 7.5% or lower.Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL is too low and can harm you.FOOT CAREPeople with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make your feet less able to feel pressure, pain, heat, or cold. You may not notice a foot injury until you have severe damage to the skin and tissue below, or you get a severe infection.Diabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.To prevent problems with your feet:Stop smoking if you smoke.Improve control of your blood sugar.Get a foot exam at least twice a year with your doctor, and learn whether you have nerve damage.Check and care for your feet every day.

It is most often diagnosed in children, adolescents, or young adults.Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy. With type 1 diabetes, beta cells produce little or no insulin.Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of going into the cells. This buildup of glucose in the blood is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 1 diabetes.The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. Most likely it is an autoimmune disorder. This is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. With type 1 diabetes, an infection or another trigger causes the body to mistakenly attack the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. The tendency to develop autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, can be passed down through families.", "When to Contact a Medical Professional": "Call 911 if you have:Chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, or other signs of anginaLoss of consciousnessSeizuresCall your doctor or go to the emergency room if you have symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis.Also call your doctor if you have:Blood sugar levels that are higher than the goals you and your doctor have setNumbness, tingling, or pain in your feet or legsProblems with your eyesightSores or infections on your feetSymptoms that your blood sugar is getting too low (weakness or fatigue, trembling, sweating, irritability, trouble thinking clearly, fast heartbeat, double or blurry vision, uneasy feeling)Symptoms that your blood sugar is too high (thirst, blurry vision, dry skin, weakness or fatigue, need to urinate a lot)Blood sugar readings that are below 70 mg/dL You can treat early signs of hypoglycemia at home by eating sugar or candy, or by taking glucose tablets.

Ask your doctor about seeing a diabetes nurse educator and a dietitian. LEARN THESE SKILLSLearning diabetes management skills will help you live well with diabetes. These skills help prevent health problems and the need for medical care. Skills include:How to test and record your blood glucoseWhat, when, and how much to eatHow to safely increase your activity and control your weightHow to take medicines, if neededHow to recognize and treat low and high blood sugarHow to handle sick daysWhere to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them It may take several months to learn these skills. Keep learning about diabetes, its complications, and how to control and live well\u00a0with the disease. Stay up-to-date on new research and treatments.MANAGING YOUR BLOOD SUGARChecking your blood sugar level yourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.To check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet. This gives you a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.Your doctor or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you. Your doctor will help you set a target range for your blood sugar numbers. Keep these factors in mind:Most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day.If your blood sugar level is under control, you may only need to check it a few times a week.You may test yourself when you wake up, before meals, and at bedtime.You may need to test more often when you are sick or under stress.You may need to test more often if you are having more frequent low blood sugar symptoms. Keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor. Based on your numbers, you may need to make changes to your meals, activity, or medicines to keep your blood sugar level in the right range. HEALTHY EATING AND WEIGHT CONTROLWork closely with your providers to learn how much fat, protein, and carbohydrates you need in your diet. Your meal plans should fit your lifestyle and habits and should include foods that you like.Managing your weight and having a well-balanced diet are important. Some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight. This does not mean that their diabetes is cured. They still have diabetes.Very obese patients whose diabetes is not well managed with diet and medicine may consider weight loss (bariatric) surgery.REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITYRegular activity is important for everyone. It is even more important when you have diabetes. Exercise is good for your health because it:Lowers your blood sugar level without medicineBurns extra calories and fat to help manage your weightImproves blood flow and blood pressureIncreases your energy levelImproves your ability to handle stress Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. People with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.MEDICINES TO TREAT DIABETESIf diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels, your doctor may prescribe medicine. Since these drugs help lower your blood sugar level in different ways, your doctor may have you take more than one drug.Some of the most common types of medicines are listed below. They are taken by mouth or injection.Alpha-glucosidase inhibitorsBiguanidesDPP IV inhibitorsInjectable medicines (GLP-1 analogs)MeglitinidesSGL T2 inhibitorsSulfonylureasThiazolidinediones You may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with any of the above medicines. Most commonly, insulin is injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or pump. Another form of insulin is the inhaled type. Insulin cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys the insulin.PREVENTING COMPLICATIONSYour doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing some of the more common complications of diabetes, including: Eye diseaseKidney diseaseHeart disease and strokeFOOT CAREPeople with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make your feet less able to feel pressure, pain, heat, or cold. You may not notice a foot injury until you have severe damage to the skin and tissue below, or you get a severe infection.Diabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.To prevent problems with your feet:Stop smoking if you smoke.Improve control of your blood sugar.Get a foot exam by your doctor at least twice a year to learn if you have nerve damage.Check and care for your feet every day. This is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems.Treat minor infections, such as athlete's foot, right away.Use moisturizing lotion on dry skin.Make sure you wear the right kind of shoes.

You can get to a healthy weight by eating healthy foods, controlling your portion sizes, and leading an active lifestyle. Some medicines can also delay or prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk of developing the disease.", "Causes": "Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy. When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.Type 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.Type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are thin.

{"Function": "Sweeteners do the following things: Provide sweet flavor when added to food.Maintain freshness and food quality.Act as a preservative in jams and jellies.Enhance flavor in processed meats.Provide fermentation for breads and pickles.Add bulk to ice cream and body to carbonated sodas.Foods containing natural sugars (such as fruit) also include vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Many foods with added sugars often add calories without nutrients. These foods and drinks are often called \"empty\" calories.Most people know that there is a lot of added sugar in soda. However, popular \"vitamin-type\" waters, sports drinks, coffee drinks, and energy drinks also contain a lot of added sugar. ", "Food Sources": "Some sweeteners are made by processing sugar compounds. Others occur naturally. \r  Sucrose (table sugar): \r  Sucrose is made from a low-sugar beet juice or sugar cane. It is made up of about half glucose and half fructose. Sucrose includes raw sugar, granulated sugar, brown sugar, confectioner's sugar, and turbinado sugar.Raw sugar is granulated, solid, or coarse. It is brown in color. Raw sugar is the solid part left when the liquid from the juice of the sugar cane evaporates.Brown sugar is made from sugar crystals that come from molasses syrup.Confectioner's sugar (also known as powdered sugar) is finely ground sucrose.Turbinado sugar is unrefined sugar made from sugar cane juice.Raw and brown sugars are no healthier than granulated white sugar.  \r  Other commonly used sugars: \r  Fructose (fruit sugar) is the naturally occurring sugar in all fruits. It is also called levulose, or fruit sugar.Honey is a combination of fructose, glucose, and water. It is produced by bees.High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and corn syrup are made from corn. Sugar and HFCS have almost the same level of sweetness. HFCS is often used in soft drinks, baked goods, and some canned products.  \r  Sugar alcohols: \r  Sugar alcohols include mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. These sweeteners are used as an ingredient in many food products that are labeled \"sugar-free\", \"diabetic\", or \"low carb\". These sweeteners are absorbed by the body at a much slower rate than sugar. They also have about half the calories of sugar. They should not be confused with sugar substitutes that are calorie free. Sugar alcohol may cause stomach cramps and diarrhea in some people.Erythritol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol found in fruit and fermented foods. It is 60 to 70% as sweet as table sugar, but has fewer calories. Also, it does not result in as much of a rise in blood sugar after meals or cause tooth decay. Unlike other sugar alcohols, it does not cause stomach upset.  \r  Other types of natural sugars: \r  Dextrose is glucose combined with water.Invert sugar is used in a liquid form to help keep candies and baked items sweet.Agave nectar is a highly processed type of sugar from the Agave tequiliana (tequila) plant. Agave nectar is about 1 1/2 times sweeter than regular sugar. It has about 60 calories per tablespoon, compared to 40 calories for the same amount of table sugar. Agave nectar is not healthier than honey, sugar, HFCS, or any other type of sweetener.Glucose is found in fruits in small amounts. It is also a syrup made from corn starch.Lactose (milk sugar) is the carbohydrate that is in milk. It is made up of glucose and galactose.Maltose (malt sugar) is produced during fermentation. It is found in beer and breads.Maple sugar comes from the sap of maple trees. It is made up of sucrose, fructose, and glucose.Molasses is taken from the residue of sugar cane processing.

Women should get no more than 100 calories per day from sugar (about 6 teaspoons of sugar).Men should get no more than 150 calories per day from sugar (about 9 teaspoons of sugar). The Dietary Guidelines for Americans also recommends limiting added sugars to no more than 10% of your calories per day. Some ways to reduce your intake of added sugars include:Drink water instead of regular soda, \"vitamin-type\" water, sports drinks, coffee drinks, and energy drinks.Eat less candy and sweet desserts such as ice cream, cookies, and cakes. There is currently no daily recommendation for the naturally occurring sugars found in milk and fruit products, but too much of any sugar can have negative effects on your health. It is important to have a balanced diet.The American Diabetes Association nutrition guidelines state that you do not need to avoid all sugar and foods with sugar if you have diabetes. You can eat limited amounts of these foods in place of other carbohydrates.If you have diabetes:Sugars affect blood glucose control the same as other carbohydrates when eaten at meals or snacks. It is still a good idea to limit foods and drinks with sugar, and to check your blood sugar levels carefully.Foods that contain sugar alcohols may have fewer calories, but be sure to read the labels for the carbohydrate content of these foods.

Do NOT put a baby to sleep on its stomach. Also, a baby can roll onto the stomach from its side, so this position should be avoided. Put babies on a firm surface (such as in the crib) to sleep. Never allow the baby to sleep in bed with other children or adults, and do NOT put them to sleep on other surfaces, such as a sofa.Let babies sleep in the same room (NOT the same bed) as parents. If possible, babies' cribs should be placed in the parents' bedroom to allow for night-time feeding.Avoid soft bedding materials. Babies should be placed on a firm, tight-fitting crib mattress without loose bedding. Use a light sheet to cover the baby. Do not use pillows, comforters, or quilts.Make sure the room temperature is not too hot. The room temperature should be comfortable for a lightly clothed adult. A baby should not be hot to the touch.Offer the baby a pacifier when going to sleep. Pacifiers at naptime and bedtime can reduce the risk for SIDS. Health care professionals think that a pacifier might allow the airway to open more, or prevent the baby from falling into a deep sleep. If the baby is breastfeeding, it is best to wait until 1 month before offering a pacifier, so that it doesn't interfere with breastfeeding.Do not use breathing monitors or products marketed as ways to reduce SIDS. Research found that these devices do not help prevent SIDS. Other recommendations from SIDS experts:Keep your baby in a smoke-free environment.Mothers should avoid alcohol and drug use during and after pregnancy.Breastfeed your baby, if possible.

A person with severe symptoms may need to go into the hospital.Treatment involves drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, to produce large amounts of urine. You should drink at least 6 to 8 glasses per day.In some cases, fluids may need to be given through a vein (by IV).Medicines may be prescribed to help dissolve the cystine crystals. Eating less salt can also decrease cystine release and stone formation.You may need pain relievers to control pain in the kidney or bladder area when you pass stones. Smaller stones most often pass through the urine on their own. Larger stones may need extra treatments. Some large stones may need to be removed with surgery:Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Sound waves are passed through the body and are focused on the stones to break them into small, passable fragments. ESWL may not work well for cystine stones because they are very hard as compared with other types of stones.Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy or nephrolithotomy.

Your children will also inherit a copy of the faulty gene from you.Cystinuria is caused by too much of an amino acid called cystine in the urine. Normally, most cystine dissolves and returns to the bloodstream after entering the kidneys. People with cystinuria have a genetic defect that interferes with this process. As a result, cystine builds up in the urine and forms crystals or stones. These crystals may get stuck in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder.About one in every 10,000 people have cystinuria. Cystine stones are most common in young adults under age 40. Less than 3% of urinary tract stones are cystine stones.", "When to Contact a Medical Professional": "Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of urinary tract stones."},
